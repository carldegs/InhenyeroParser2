1. Place masterdata.csv to the /public folder.
    - Make sure that masterdata.csv is exported as CSV (MS-DOS)
    - Make sure that the file contains the following columns in order:
        - studentNum    - org2Name      - telephone
        - lastName      - org2Pos       - address
        - firstName     - org3Name      - writeup
        - middleName    - org3Pos       - packageType
        - course        - email         - filler*
        - org1Name      - mobile
        - org1Pos       - birthday
    - There should be a filler column at the end of each entry, that only contains a '/' character.
    - There should be no row headers. Row 1 must contain the first subscriber data.

2. Place the images on the /public/images folder.
    - each course must have its own subfolder

3. Run the code
    a. Open a command window on the main folder
        - Press Ctrl + Right Click then select open command window here
    b. To ONLY generate the csv files, input:
            java -jar InhenyeroParser.jar
       To ONLY rename the images, input:
            java -jar InhenyeroParser.jar -rename
       To ONLY rename the image without printing a report, input:
            java -jar InhenyeroParser.jar -rename -noreport
       To generate CSV and rename images, input:
            java -jar InhenyeroParser.jar -rename -csv
    c. The code will now run.

4. Check the outputs
