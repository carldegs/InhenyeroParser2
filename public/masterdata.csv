But then, putting on earplugs isn?t recommended if you want to experience the joy and happiness she brings. There is no need to open your eyes for you to notice her. Just by listening to her sweet voice, you will feel calm and comfortable. It can even take you to places where problems are not within reach. Her voice sounds like never-ending laughter and it is through her voice that you will be acquainted with her different sides. At times, you will hear the sound of anger, frustration, sadness, and loneliness, but she can deal with those negativities and turn them into strengths. Her graceful dance gives a vibrant approach. She moves perfectly just like how she treats everyone around. She compasses her hand, kneels, and speaks to the Almighty. Just in case you aren?t able to close your eyes, you will see a glamorous girl just like a pure, white lotus.;D;/

At any random time of the year, ask and she is more than willing to take you on a trip to the beach. Jodie appreciates and rejoices in the simplest of things?the good company of family and close friends, a picturesque view of the sand and sea, and even the sweet kiss of the sea waves on her feet. Jodie's beauty, outside and most especially inside her, is like the rays of the sun that radiate once you get to know her. She makes the people close to her heart value the memories they share even with her corniest jokes and childlike stories. As a friend, she is like one of those rare pieces of shell you find buried in the countless sand along the beach which makes you feel super lucky you have found. She is not afraid to test and swim through the waters and no doubt, she has and will surely continue to remain strong as she surpasses any of the storms and turbulent waves that would come her way.;A;/

It will make you do things that you don't usually do. It will give you requirements where deadlines seem to approach faster than in our high school days. It will immerse you in a world where you will feel joy, sadness, love, pain, or all of them at the same time. But despite all these, college life is not just about the hardships. It is also an experience.

For every failing mark, I learned to study harder. For every presentation, I yearned to believe in myself that I can do it. Moreover, what's important about college is getting to meet new people, new acquaintances, and new friends. They helped me get through all the obstacles for about five years. Now, having finished college, I can say that it is an experience well-earned that will help me push through the next chapters of my life.";A;/

She recognizes her strengths and weaknesses and she knows very well her dreams and values, which consistently reflect in her actions and decisions.

Being a balanced scale on an uneven surface, a lot of things try to shake the table where it rests or add loads on an impact with the purpose of making it unstable or overturning it. Some of them also try to add weights more than the pans can handle, having a portion of the weights lost in the process.

Considering that the balance tries to stabilize itself and keep the weights on its pans, there are people and things who either take the weights on one side, or add some on the other, to keep it from toppling and relieve it from reaching its overturning moment or yield stress; thus, it is still able to go on for longer under that situation.

Ako ay isang estudyante sa kursong BS Civil Engineering na ga-graduate (hopefully) sa school year na 2015-2016. 

Actually di ko talaga alam ang ilalagay sa write-up so kung anu-ano na lang ilalagay ko. Mahilig ako sa computer games pero naglalaro rin naman ng ilang sports gaya ng tennis at volleyball. Bilang isang ""gamer,"" sumali ako sa isang org na na-establish lamang noong 2013?ang UP Gaming Guild. Di ako naging active noong unang taong na-recognize ito dahil laging nagco-conflict 'yung events sa acads, pero buti na lang at kinaya nang maging active this sem. 

So, 200+ characters na lang pala pwede. Ano pa ba malalagay ko? Hopefully, grumaduate na ako kapag nabasa ko ito sa yearbook mismo since delayed ako ng one year sa pag-graduate. Sana may trabaho na rin ako at nakatutulong na sa mga magulang ko. So ayun lang. :)";A;/

Don?t blame anyone else for your own shortcomings. Always give your best (on exams, reports, requirements, etc). Your best means your 90%. When taking an exam, always leave one mistake for humility.

Through the years, I met people who changed the way I viewed the UP education and helped me realize that spending my college life focusing on academics alone does not guarantee my success in the future. These people also made me understand that each person has his or her own strengths and weaknesses, and purpose in life. Such realizations helped me survive the moments when I felt like giving up and all seemed to fall apart (especially during hell weeks). Let's be honest, exams in the College of Engineering can be life-changing. 

Now that this journey as an undergraduate student is coming to a close, another gate will open.

We sometimes think to ourselves that we are nobody. But we are people too; we can?t be nobody and still exist. In fact, we may even be everything to somebody. It?s not even important for us to know that that somebody exists in our lives; what?s important is we know our own worth.

She's the kind of person who always tries to look at the bright side in any situation. No matter how deep she falls, she manages to pick herself up and carry on. She brings her fun and quirky personality with her wherever she goes. Her laughter and smiles can really lighten up your day. There is never a dull moment with her around. She's a very passionate person, excelling in everything she puts her heart in. When she sets her mind on a certain goal, she makes sure she reaches it. I really hope she becomes the person she set out to be. I don't think she knows it yet, but I have a great feeling she's going to make a big difference in other people's lives someday.;D;/

Bolivar St., Filinvest 1, Batasan Hills, Quezon City;"UP has always promoted an air of excellence. That its graduates would be those that lead the country and change the world. That we are the hope and dreams of the future. 

And honestly, that's just suffocating. 

Not everyone is born to be a leader because, let's face it, if we were all leaders, who would be left to follow? Sometimes we're just another cog in the machine and that's fine, there's nothing wrong with that. The problem lies in the expectations of those around us for us to be the top of our fields, and when the majority of us fail to reach that goal, our reward is crushing disappointment from our families, our colleagues, and ourselves. 

What people need to accept is that everyone has their limits. What's important is that once you've found your place in the world?whether it be as a leader or as a follower?you put in the excellence that UP strives to promote in the work that you do. 

Find no shame in the life you live, as long as you live it to the fullest.";B;/

Unlike his being naturally smart, only a few people are aware that Karlos is gifted with a good singing voice and a perfect pitch?something that gives him an advantage to superbly play the guitar and the piano. And it may not seem obvious but he is also a sports enthusiast and enjoys tennis, basketball, badminton, and chess among others. 

Despite being all of these, he remains humble and simple. With a heart that's open to anyone who needs help, he willingly fixes a broken laptop, tutors a challenged student, and accepts favors from friends. These admirable qualities, along with him being an obedient son, have all contributed to making him a responsible leader. Truly, Karlos has gotten the best of not just both, but of many worlds. ;)

I would have to revise it since UP, as a whole, has already fulfilled that expectation. UP will teach you how it feels to be crushed by failure, which I didn?t take positively, but the UP community will help you get back on your feet, only to fail once more. With each failure, I have seen myself grow and adapt to the feeling of it, and I have learned how to turn each failure into something that I can use. UP will teach you how to love and be loved, and it will also teach you the bitterness of being deserted. But what makes UP unique is that for every hurdle that comes your way, it offers a lot of new chances to learn and to grow as a person. That is why, at the end of it all, if given the chance to go back and to change my university of choice, I would still choose UP in a heartbeat.;D;/

In case you are wondering what your undergrad self was like, here are some things to help you remember. 

I like eating with my family and friends and I enjoy being part of the organizations I belong to. I find it more effective to study very early in the morning than to study late at night, and I think I should fix my tendency to cram. I enjoy doing art-related things and I feel at ease when I?m with my backpack. 

I am not the person our seven-year-old self imagined me to be but there is still something we have in common. From when we were young up to the present, there are times when a part of us wants to give up on something and times when we hesitate to try something out. But despite these, we would decide to listen to the part of us which chooses to strive to eventually accomplish our goals. I do not know if you are what I imagined you to be many years from now, but I hope you still choose not to give up. 

Good luck!

He?s protective when it comes to the people he cares about, but not suffocating, and knows when to step back and admit that he?s wrong.?

Dila, Santa Rosa, Laguna;"This moment has come. Thanks be to God. Today, I look back to the time I took the UPCAT. I remember accidentally dropping and breaking glasses at home after the exam. They were six. I knew I would pass and I did!

I studied my major and minor subjects and felt regret when I was a junior because I only had major subjects. I experienced studying for a math exam for three days and felt sad for having a low score. I said, ""Babawi ako.? I told others, ""Kaya mo ?yan."" I also remembered others' quotes when I felt like quitting; I?m thankful for those.

Academics is not the only thing needed to be smart, I knew. I spent my college life well, organized events, watched musical or theater presentations, and listened and learned about issues in our society from different talks.

Thanks, UP, for molding me not only to be smart in my field but to be a well-rounded student and person of this country. Such incomparable years I had with you. Thank you, Mama, Papa, UP, and friends! Thank you, God!";B;/

Yet sometimes I wonder if you do too much pursuing, not enough resting; if the forces that are trying to wear and tear you out are working. And then I remember that God allows brokenness because it's the cracks that let the light in. More importantly, it's the cracks that let the light out. You are that ball of sunlight, constantly giving away sunshine faster than you absorb it.

When a sleepless night of exhaustion and doubt comes, remember: There is always room for more love, even more so when we feel emptied out.

Day 1600

I lost my diary in our last encounter so I had to log everything again.

Nobody thought college life would turn out to be a zombie apocalypse. Everyone had only one thing in mind: survive. Adapting to changes during the first months were difficult. I learned how to eat books. The third year was the toughest?zombie professors kept giving us problems. They came in hordes during midterms and finals; sleep was scarce. We accidentally discovered shotguns (the ones done overnight) that were effective against them.

Joining the Guild was fun as I gained a new perspective in life. Falling in love was not a good idea; my friend fell in love with a girl who turned out to be a zombie. She took his heart. Literally.

We have 239 days left before commencement. Though our survival is still uncertain, I leave this as a message to everyone out there seeking refuge. We only experience this life once. No matter how impossible challenges may seem, never give up. And run fast.";A;/

Don?t forget everything you?ve learned in this university. No, I?m not just talking about the notes that you made in the wee hours of the morning. I?m also talking about those conversations you had with your dearest friends, the inspiring words your professors have said during their lectures. You finally stopped yourself from hiding who you really are. From here on out, you have a duty to become the best version of yourself.

Don?t forget that you have the potential to change everything and everyone around you. Every action you do, every word you say?no matter how small and insignificant you think it is?can lead to something you will be proud of or something that you will regret in the future. May that sablay on your chest remind you that you don't just belong to yourself, but also to your country.

Things that will either make you say ""What was wrong with me?"" or ""I made the right choice."" I was driven by the thought of freedom?the thought of being able to say, ""I am my own person."" 

I tried to prove to myself, and to the people around me, that I was more than what they think I am. I made a lot of choices?some good, most dumb. However, being driven enabled me to do so much more than what I thought I could. My hunger for freedom gave me the courage to step out of my comfort zone, to try out new things, to be crazy, to be wild. It made me realize that I had no limits?that I was free all along. 

Live a life that is driven by something, someone, anything. You'd be surprised at what'll come next.";D;/

In my five years of studying in UP, I'm grateful that my mind was opened to all sorts of realities I had to face. I can say that I learned a lot, but it doesn't end there. What I decide to do next is far more important. What I want to say is that I will not put to waste the opportunity I was given to study in UP. As engineers, let's work together to make our country a better place to live in.

It has been determined since my first year in the University. I grew complacent. I tried to keep up with my 'academically godly' friends. For three semesters, I believed that I wasn't cut out for this. I wasn't good enough. 

My life here is full of short-lived ups and downs, like the 220 VAC we have?a sinusoid that goes up and down 60 times per second. Two semesters later, I hadn't realized that I was actually moving up the curriculum. Also, I found those whom I can walk and learn with at the same pace. I found love. I found happiness. I found how I most effectively learn. 

Another year passed, now I know and appreciate what we've been modelling for the past four years. After a few months' worth of pep talk from my family, friends, and advisers, I finally accepted that I can keep up. I can learn even faster. I can do the things they do. I can be better.

Sometimes, this is enough to empower us to change and conquer our day-to-day troubles. After all, there is no greater motivator than failure.

Sa mga kaibigang lagi kong inaasar, ilang years na rin tayong magkakilala. Sanay naman na kayo, 'di ba? Haha. Joke. Labyu.
Sa mga kaibigan kong isang beses lang sa isang sem gustong magkita-kita, maraming salamat. Sana dalasan na natin. :))";A;/

As a kid, I used to say that I wanted to be an engineer when I grew up. But where and how, I had no idea. During the last year of high school, while students were planning for college, I was busy hanging out or raising my character's level in an online game. I'm a happy-go-lucky, go-with-the-flow kind of guy. Well, I used to be.

Luckily, my dad told me to try and take the UPCAT. I remember him quoting Wayne Gretzky: ?You miss 100% of the shots you don?t take.? Good thing I listened. Because UP has made a huge impact on my life. It has taught me a lot and not only about engineering. It has altered my way of thinking and my way of seeing and doing things. It made me outgrow my go-with-the-flow attitude and realize that I am the captain of my ship. It made me understand what I can do and how much I could affect others. It showed me a direction and gave me purpose.

For honor and excellence. UP, I won?t let you down.";A;/

It was a lengthy process full of ups and downs, surprises, and learning to pick myself up for the future that I envision; a journey made meaningful by the people who became part of it; and an ending manufactured by the experiences and lessons gathered along the way. It was hard but it was all worth it.

He brings with him a presence that immediately commands a room. His ability to instantly charm you with his company is unique. A true leader, he has this strange power to make people follow him. 

The next word: PASSION. I can say that Neil Clark is a very passionate guy. May it be with academics, family, or inuman, he always gives it his 110%. He never succumbs to mediocrity and refuses to settle with what falls short of excellence. 

The last word: NAKAMA. Neil Clark is the main character of his shounen anime life. Just like any shounen lead, he finds friendship wherever he goes. He is someone who will share the burden of your problems and will stand by you through the good and bad. It truly is a privilege to have Neil as a brother.";A;/

Uncanny friendship, I?d say. Despite all these differences, we shared each other?s bliss and sorrow. We became each other?s rock. 

You were never the one to break rules because you'd rather make your own. There were times when you always stayed in what was familiar or safe. You mostly passed on doing things because you think there?ll be other times to make it happen. This time, however, I?m telling you to LET GO. 

Like mining, life is a work of patience, persistence, and luck. It takes a lot of digging, waiting, and hoping until you find a piece of value. And, now, your time of mining is DONE. You dug your way through five years in college, waited for this fine gem of a moment, and hoped for the golden find.

She?s the clingy and ?makulit? kind of friend who?s always there for you?ready to listen to you, laugh with you, cry with you. She always has her family at the top of her priorities. She?s willing to sacrifice so much for them and would do anything to make them proud. In fact, her father was her inspiration to become a successful engineer.

This might be an exaggeration, but from what I know about Brylle, he does not back down from challenges. And that is one trait a leader should possess. He pulls through any difficulty in his way. He manages to unite an organization whose members all look up to him. He is a person full of bright ideas and ingenuity. He loves what he does and is good at it. When he puts his heart into something, excellent results are sure to come your way. Brylle can liven up any dull moment as he is always ready with the best punch lines. Probably, one of his best traits is that he is good at dealing with people. No stranger is a stranger to Brylle. He can talk to the most awkward, or even the angriest person, and make them happy even just for a while.;B;/

Without conquering one's virtue and desires, thou shall fall into darkness. Darkness dwells in each heart. Those who would deny this fall ever further into darkness. Yet, without darkness, there can be no light. So how can darkness be truly evil? Darkness is what makes you realize that you need light. All paths lead you to the future and create it as it is what you desired. 

One day darkness will consume you. It may be hard but do not let it break you. The harsh truth learnt can lead you back to the future you wanted. So, go forth on your story.

Reminisce every experience you had in college. Savor the time you aced that major exam and contemplate the time you thought everything was falling apart. College is one hell of a roller coaster ride. Enjoy it while you?re still in it. 

Write everything until you exhaust all the ideas in your mind. College is a creative stage in life. Try new things. You'll eventually find something that makes you feel alive and proud of yourself. 

Lastly, revise what you have so it gets better. Good things don?t always come the first time around. It?s okay to make mistakes; they are a part of life. But always learn from them. They are there not to bring you down but to teach you lessons you won?t learn in class. 

Now that you?re done with your write-up, I hope you?re proud of what you've made. If not, there?s always a second chance. There's another roller coaster ride waiting after college. Next time, maybe you can make a write-up you'd be proud of.";B;/

He?s the type of person to make jokes not to be the center of attention but to lift the mood of the people he?s with. Behind his laid-back personality is his kind heart, as he brightens the day through his humor that comes with thoughtfulness.

When she was in her early years of college, she told herself to ""Never be normal."" And because of that, she has made some decisions not many people choose, such as shifting to another course and spending a year in another country. After staying a couple of years more than the usual four or five years in the university, she thought, ""I just want to be normal. Do the things that my friends are already doing.""

But after some introspection, she told herself, ""Normal is kind of boring. It's okay. We all have our own pacing. Learn and enjoy life."" She also remembered the last lines from the poem, Desiderata.

""With all its sham, drudgery and broken dreams, it is still a beautiful world. Be cheerful. Strive to be happy.""";C;/

Just kidding. 

I cannot exactly remember when or why I became friends with him, but I am really glad that he is part of my college life. But wait, this is not about me, this is about LO. 

He is very frank, which can be a good thing since being honest is better than being plastic, but sometimes his approach irks some people. He may always seem talkative, loud, and a bit insulting, but he has a soft and caring side. His outer appearance does not necessarily reflect his inner side. When a friend of his needs help, he is there willing to listen and give advice, but as I told you, his approach is quite different since he will lighten up the situation by saying jokes, insults, and sometimes curses. He is really a good friend; he just needs to be understood deeply. With all of these, LO is definitely the person that you can talk to and hang out with.

She is loved by an unconditional love?a love that nothing can separate her from. Knowing this, she never really put her whole trust in herself. Instead, she placed them in the One who made her, to her Father, to the King, to her Maker, to her best friend, to her eternal supply of love. And as she continues this journey, she believes that she has something more to discover. As this chapter of life ends, she doesn?t really own the credit. She offers it to the God who made it possible for her to make it, to the One who puts her into it and gets her out of it. This lady knows that wherever she may be, it is her God who placed her there. Wherever she may be, she longs to be able to radiate the love and the light that she abundantly receives.;B;/

Procedure: 

Step 1. In a mixing bowl, blend a handful amount of left side brain and right side brain. Be careful of the components as it may become unstable when agitated. Set aside and wait for the mixture to turn green. Take note of how fast it will take to change colors. 

Step 2. After it turns green, slowly pour in any 80 proof alcohol to the mixture. Be careful not to pour drastically as it may cause unwanted reactions like pink effervescence, green gas, etc. If it explodes, play dead. 

Step 3. Prepare 800 mg of Aspirin and dissolve it in the mixture. It will turn the mixture into colorless liquid. This can now be used as an experimental refrigerant or fuel with unique properties such as high internal energy, high entropy, low density, etc. 

(The experiment author would like to thank the Family and Friends Institute (FFI) for the financial, emotional, and passionate support for finishing the experimental setup, and UP for the source of left and right brains";B;/

It was amusing, as we knew that it was too rare to cultivate naturally. To have one was equal to being impossible?a long shot, a crazy idea. Then again, Pat has always had her mind set on the impossible. Anything she puts her mind to comes to life. She is a master of intricacies and rigor; her self-made collection of duct tape roses strewn in her car is one proof. Beneath her seriousness, however, lies a sweet side. She is always one to listen and give the advice that a person would need, and it is an understatement to say she would stay by you when the time calls for it. Her love for her friends is almost as much as her love for chocolate: excessive. To see Pat would also mean seeing her carrying a Kinder Surprise egg without fail. A diligent, ambitious, responsible, and caring person, Pat is a rarity in herself. It is safe to say that there is no need for a blue rose, for she already is one.

Sila ay sabik sa karunungan na tiyak na gagamitin nila sa tama, para sa ikauunlad, hindi lamang ng kanyang buhay ngunit ng sangkatauhan. 

Sila ay marangal; hindi hinahangad ang dumaan sa mga ""shortcuts,"" bagkus nais maranasan lahat ng hirap, sakit, at saya. Kaya nilang tumayo sa kanilang sariling mga paa ngunit hindi sila nakalilimot sa kanilang pinagdaanan at sa mga taong tumulong at humubog ng kanilang pagkatao.

For most of us, the moment we stepped into this university was the moment our dreams became a reality. We worked hard to get where we are right now, and true enough, that first step was the easiest one. 

Several years have passed, and now we're nearing the end. We've made it past several quizzes, long exams, papers, reports, design projects, etc. We've kept ourselves indulged with academics and org stuff, sharing political and social interests. We've most certainly had countless sleepless nights, cramming to meet deadlines, all working our way to reach the ultimate goal: to graduate. 

UP has indeed cultivated us. It has changed our perspective?the way we see and analyze the things that matter, things aside from our academics. Now that we are to set foot on the real world, let's not falter, let's continue to soar. 

Always uphold honor and excellence. Live free. Explore. Be the harbinger of change.";B;/

I hope to be choked out solid and tough with all the knowledge and abilities UP endowed me. 

Among the greatest privileges, I am forever thankful as Iskolar ng Bayan is my academic journey with fellow Isko and Iska, and professors from various fields with exceptional wits and talents. 

As a liberal educational institution, UP holds different sorts of knowledge and philosophies. As I prepare to step out, I'm confident of not losing the most important knowledge of all?the words of God. This Bible passage can be read from my high school yearbook entry and I?m glad to share it once again, this time with you. Proverbs 3:5-6 says this:

?[5] Trust in the Lord with all your heart, And lean not on your own understanding; [6] In all your ways acknowledge Him, And He shall direct your paths.?";A;/

Yes, you read that right. You've finished the first stage of this game called life. And yes, just the first stage?the easiest stage where the game creator spoon-feeds you with just the need-to-know basics. Finishing this stage does not equate to finishing the actual game. But keep your confidence; this also means that you still have those remaining stages to show the world what you've got. You may not be in the top percentage like Joey's Rattata, but remember that even a Magikarp can sweep the entire Elite Four. Learn from Mario's perseverance, going as far as World 8 just to save Peach (just don't eat the mushroom). Be ready; as Rocket Executive Proton said in HGSS, ""It doesn?t matter where we go, there?s always someone that doesn?t agree with us.""

And always remember what Mr. Hanekoma said, ""The world ends with you. If you want to enjoy life, expand your world. You gotta push your horizons as far as they?ll go.""

P.S. I like shorts! They?re comfy and easy to wear.";D;/

As you travel the roads, oceans and streams; As you hurdle your challenges and follow your dreams;
But when you are besieged at your walls of belief, I will come to share burden, to give you relief.
I will not flee, I will not fail. I will not fall into fear, I?ll defend this ground right beside you here.
The fear that I fear lives only in my mind, And pain is a word I refuse to define.
With you I shall rule or with you I expire, Just to stand here as one is all I desire.
Through us, the world?can dream about peace; Through us, the night?can finally cease.
If only they knew about our valor and sins, much history was written by the blood of our kin.
In your good company, my fellow, I will never feel alone, My pride is refueled when you remind me of home.
A lifetime is too short for there?s more light I can give, For with you I feel young?forever shall I live.

The testimonies from the alumni with fantastic careers, the national icons whose principles were honed in the University, the song ""Ang Awit ng Kabataan,"" and Eraserheads have enticed me to strive for UP. Its Honor and Excellence and its images of patriotism and oblation have truly motivated me to pursue the vision.

However, I failed the UPCAT. Envy, insecurities, and frustrations drowned my dream. But God reminded me that how I finish was far more important than how I start. With His intervention, I was able to transfer from Adamson to UP.

Though probsets, recits, machine probs, tech papers, and plates beset me everyday, I am confident that He who began the good work in me will finish it until the end.

And as I graduate from UP, the call of being an oblation, isang kabataang mag-aalay ng buhay para sa Bayan (El Filibusterismo), is loud and clear. I will abide and be faithful to this cause. Para sa Diyos. Para sa Bayan.";B;/

Pero kasi ang nakatatakot pagdating mo sa labas, giyera na. Ika nga, survival of the fittest. Handa na nga ba tayo?

All of us entered UP thinking that we were among the few best. Fueled by our own set of goals, we all thought we?re unbeatable. But then, along the way, we faced unexpected challenges and were saturated with all kinds of stress?acads, extra-curriculars, personal problems.

Lahat tayo dumating sa time na nadapa tayo. At hindi lang once. One way or another, there were times we questioned our decisions, many instances when we doubted ourselves and asked ?Ba't nga ba ako nandito??

Pero kahit ano pang reklamo at pagdududa, hindi pa rin sumuko. We kept going. LABAN! One step at a time. Kasi dito sa UP, matututunan mong pwedeng mapagod, pero bawal sumuko. Kaya natin! We can do anything if we just keep going.

She is a woman who walks with a purpose. When you look at her, you?ll see the beauty of her intellect, the love and compassion that she radiates, and the very special person that she is. Her heart beats with passion and her hands love to work hard. Her every act of kindness waters someone's thirsty soul. Her friendship is forever and her love for her family is deep like the night. She is more than a light in the darkness. Her soul is truly a place of authentic and timeless beauty. She never doubts the magic of miracles and always believes in the power of prayer. I am hugely impressed by how she remains humble and simple despite the dreamy life that she is living. I am certain that God is really happy with what He sees in her life. 

To her future husband/first boyfriend, I have one word for you: blessed. Because Joanna is a once-in-a-lifetime woman.

First, I would like to dedicate this achievement to my Lolo Ciano who passed away recently. Even though he?s not here with us, I know that he is watching over our family and smiling from heaven.

I would also like to thank my parents, family, friends, teachers, and classmates. All the courage I have in this long journey is inspired by these people. Sometimes, difficulties tend to intimidate me and dampen my spirit, but my family and friends would not let me back down. They give me the strength and courage to face these obstacles by believing in me and inspiring me. Also, the dedication that I have seen from all my teachers, classmates, and the whole ICE humbles me and pushes me to strive hard and be the best that I am.

As an event head, she will do everything to make it big and successful. As a friend, she will always greet you with her big smile. Some may also describe her as a jolly and nice person. Overall, she's just such an amazing woman. 

For me, there are only two words that describe her: my everything. 

She?s the star which my world revolves around; my light and hope when I?m lost in the darkness; my strength when I?m weak. This could go on and on and on... 

Yes, perhaps, she may have her flaws. But is it really important to know these things? Who cares if she?s moody or stubborn at times? I can brag that maybe I?m the only one who knows her feeble side, but I don?t want her to change just because of some trivial stuff. All these traits make her who she is. I will accept every part of her. I will always and truly love her for the rest of my life.

? Pope Francis, ?Laudato Si?

After college graduation, the world had many things to offer and it was overwhelming. We have started to become proud and divided. We looked at ourselves more than the others. We have lost our sight for greater things because we stopped to listen.

We failed to listen because we allowed false competence to lead the way. And we stopped to listen until we could not hear the quiet beat of our own hearts.

We were weary until we realized that a granule of sugar was never sufficient to make a cup of coffee sweet and we stumbled until we became wise enough to stir it.

Then, we face again the world with new knowledge and more wisdom in our hands, still with little courage in our hearts. But now, openhandedly, we listen to the cry of the earth and cry of the poor, and we are not looking anymore at what the world has to offer, but what we have to give until we can hear again the beat of our own hearts.";A;/

She is not the kind of woman that will get your attention whenever she enters the room but when your eyes catch her and you happen to look into her life deeply, you?ll see that indeed, God is with her. She is a simple cheerful lady who is always enthusiastic to learn. She can keep her friends without neglecting her academic duties nor her ministry responsibilities. See? How can she squeeze all her tasks? And yes, she has her fair share of difficulties and she tells them to me (though perhaps not every single one). But all I see is a woman full of courage as she overcomes challenges in life. If she comes upon a fork in the road, she would have definitely chosen the right path of pursuing what she wants to be master of. In this place, she has found affirmation.;A;/
